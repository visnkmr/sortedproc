**SortedProcessors** is a web application built with **Next.js** (React) and **TypeScript** that allows users to explore, filter, sort, and compare various **processor models** based on their specifications and technical characteristics. It's designed to help users make informed decisions when considering a new processor.

## üöÄ Features

- ### üß† **Extensive Processor Database**
  Includes a wide range of processor models from manufacturers like **Intel**, **AMD**, **Apple**, **Qualcomm**, **MediaTek**, **Samsung**, **IBM**, and more.

- ### üéõÔ∏è **Specification Filtering**
  Filter processors using interactive sliders and selectors based on:
  - `p_cores`
  - `e_cores`
  - `total_threads`
  - `base_power_tdp_w`
  - `max_turbo_power_w`
  - `p_core_base_clock_ghz`
  - `p_core_boost_clock_ghz`
  - `e_core_base_clock_ghz`
  - `e_core_boost_clock_ghz`
  - `l2_cache_mb`
  - `l3_cache_mb`
  - `initial_price_usd_approx`
  - And more...

- ### üîç **Search Functionality**
  Quickly find processors by **model name**.

- ### üè∑Ô∏è **Manufacturer Filtering**
  Filter processors by **manufacturer**.

- ### ‚ÜïÔ∏è **Sorting**
  Sort processors by:
  - Model
  - Release Year
  - Price
  - Cores/Threads
  - Power (TDP)
  - Clock Speeds
  - Cache Sizes
  - Manufacturing Node
  - Socket Type
  - **Custom Calculated Metrics**

- ### üìå **Pinning**
  Pin a processor to compare it side-by-side with others using **percentage-based differences** in key metrics.

- ### ‚≠ê **Starring**
  Mark your **favorite processors** and access them quickly from a starred list.

- ### üîÑ **Comparison Filters**
  Apply **conditional comparisons** (e.g., greater than/less than) relative to the pinned processor.

- ### üìä **Dynamic Range Sliders**
  Slider ranges adjust based on **min/max values** from all processors for each metric.

- ### üì± **Responsive Design**
  Fully responsive UI optimized for **desktops, tablets, and mobile devices**.

- ### üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è **Toggle Filter Visibility**
  Easily **show or hide filters** for a clean and focused user interface.

- ### ‚ö° **Performance**

```

To start the application in production mode:

```bash
npm start
#or
yarn start
```

### Project Structure
- src/app/page.tsx: Main page component for the application.
- src/app/models.tsx: Contains the data for all Processor models.
- src/components/ui/: Components that come from shadcn/ui
- other usual nextjs folders.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you want to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
- Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages.
- Push your branch to your forked repository.
- Submit a pull request to the main branch of the original repository.

### Adding New Processor Models
To add new Processor models, follow these steps:

- Open the src/app/models.tsx file.
- Add the new Processor model data as a new object in the corresponding model series array (e.g., intel13,intel14,etc.).
- Ensure that the new Processor data conforms to the ProcessorData type definition in src/app/page.tsx.
- If a new model series is added, Add the exported model series to page.tsx file.
- Submit a pull request.
